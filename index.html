          <p>
            PRISM is a novel framework that offers a fresh perspective on
            programming. Traditionally, key aspects of programming — such as
            specification and implementation, formal and applied methods, and
            static and dynamic verification — are often viewed as distinct and
            even opposing concepts. PRISM challenges this notion by providing a
            unified, mathematically rigorous foundation that integrates these
            elements seamlessly.
          </p>

          <p>
            Currently, the project comprises a
            <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17149">research paper</a>, sonn
            published as part of a Festschrift honoring
            <a href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~gurevich/">Yuri Gurevich</a>,
            along with the
            <a href="https://github.com/CI-CSE/PRISM/tree/main/Isabelle"
              >formal proofs</a
            >
            of the paper’s theorems, developed in
            <a href="https://isabelle.in.tum.de/">Isabelle HOL</a>. Moving
            forward, PRISM will continue to be refined and expanded, with the
            ultimate goal of enabling the generation of formally verified
            programming languages.

            A re-construction of the fundamentals of programming as a small
            mathematical theory (“PRISM”) based on elementary set theory.
            Highlights:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Zero axioms. No properties are assumed, all are proved (from
              standard set theory).
            </li>
            <li>A single concept covers specifications and programs.</li>
            <li>Its definition only involves one relation and one set.</li>
            <li>
              Everything proceeds from three operations: choice, composition and
              restriction.
            </li>
            <li>
              These techniques suffice to derive the axioms of classic papers on
              the “laws of programming” as consequences and prove them
              mechanically.
            </li>
            <li>
              The ordinary subset operator suffices to define both the notion of
              program correctness and the concepts of specialization and
              refinement.
            </li>
            <li>
              From this basis, the theory deduces dozens of theorems
              characterizing important properties of programs and programming.
            </li>
            <li>
              All these theorems have been mechanically verified (using
              Isabelle/HOL); the proofs are available in a public repository.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            This paper is a considerable extension and rewrite of an
            <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.00723">earlier contribution</a>.
